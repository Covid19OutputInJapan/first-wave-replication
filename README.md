# first-wave-replication
This project aims to replicate the mathematical model analysis of the crowd control policy early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The codes are written in MATLAB, and the parameters used in the codes are the same as [Nishiura's ones](https://github.com/contactmodel/COVID19-Japan-Reff/blob/master/)

## DEMO

## Features

Explanation of some features if necessary


## Note

Several models are compared including Barkley Madonna, the discrete-time, and the continuous-time model.
Values of the discrete-time model are calculated in the code with the prefix "DT". 
Those of the continuous-time model is calculated in the code with the prefix "CT".
The files with the prefix "seeerrors" draw graphs and compare each scenario to show the difference in values between the models.
